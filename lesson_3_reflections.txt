I will use remote repositories every time i want to collaborate with other people
and/or every time i would like to share some code or docs
to other people. I think it is a wonderfull idea because is the base to improve
code , software and human activities in general.

Manual pull and push changes helps keep code in better control. As it is the
case with the staging area, this is an additional step that put you on hold for
a moment to think in your decision. Additionally , you probably need to keep
working on what you got locally before moving it to the shared repository so
this is the ooportunity.
