When you initialize a repository (with git init), a simple repository becames
a git repository. A hidden directory (.git) contains all the artifacts required
by git to keep track of commits, status, checkouts, branches, etc.
git status can be used to understand which files in the repository are under
version control. git log can be used to see the existing commits.
